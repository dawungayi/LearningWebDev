    <h2>movieDB</h2>
    <p> Create an array of movie objects. Each movie should have a title, rating and hasWatched properties. The last piece is to iterate through the array and print out something that looks like: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have watched "Die Hard" - 4.5 stars </li>
        <li>You have not watched "Forrest Gump" - 5 stars</li>
        <li>You have watched "Mr and Mrs Smith" 4 stars</li>
        <li>You have not watched "The Smurfs" - 4.5 stars</li>
    </ul>
